## Welcome to Justin's personal website

Hello my name is Guanda Chen, from Changsha, Hunan, China. I am studying Mathematics at the University of Warwick. On this website, I want to share my experience, music, projects and my thoughts on different things.


### Music

[长大](https://music.163.com/#/song?id=1817906834) means growing up. It is the 18-year-old birthsday gift to myself as I was turning to an adult. On the one hand, it tells that I don't want to grow up as my families are becoming aging if I grow up. However, I must grow up to take the responsibility to face the society.



### Projects

We did not win, but we learned:
1. Entrepreneur Competition
- My thought is to use data to help retail store maintaining their business.

2. [Case Competition](guandachenn.github.io/WCG_Guanda Chen.pdf)
- We did research on Automobile market, I developped a mathematical model to analyze the advantages and disadvantages.

3. Research on the Effect of Artificial Intelligience on Education.



### Experience
1. Shangri-la teaching aid.
2.
