## Welcome to Justin's personal website

Hello my name is Guanda Chen, from Changsha, Hunan, China. I am studying Mathematics at the University of Warwick. On this website, I want to share my experience, music, projects and my thoughts on different things.


### Interest
#### Quant: Confirming my first career direction on Quantitative trading on 2022 summer:
I will update the effort I put on this web. 

[The ways of turtles](https://github.com/guandachenn/quant_the_ways_of_turtle) is the first book on trading I have ever read, I have quantified the strategy by python, however, this is the project mostly by others from open resources. But I have coded again line by line by myself again, and I learned that to program a useful system, we need to have 3 factors: 

1. Find theTrading signals
2. Getting the data
3. Put the trading strategy in codes



### Music

[长大](https://music.163.com/#/song?id=1817906834) means growing up. It is the 18-year-old birthsday gift to myself as I was turning to an adult. On the one hand, it tells that I don't want to grow up as my families are becoming aging if I grow up. However, I must grow up to take the responsibility to face the society.



### Projects

We did not win, but we learned:
1. Entrepreneur Competition
- My thought is to use data to help retail store maintaining their business.

2. Case Competition

- We did research on Automobile market, I developped a mathematical model to analyze the advantages and disadvantages.

3. Research on the Effect of Artificial Intelligience on Education.



### Experience
1. Shangri-la teaching aid.
2.
