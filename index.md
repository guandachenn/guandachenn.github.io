## Welcome to Justin's personal website

Hello my name is Guanda Chen, from Changsha, Hunan, China. I am studying Mathematics at the University of Warwick. On this website, I want to share my experience, music, projects and my thoughts on different things.


### Music

[长大](https://music.163.com/#/song?id=1817906834) means growing up. It is the 18-year-old birthsday gift to myself as I was turning to an adult. On the one hand, it tells that I don't want to grow up as my families are becoming aging if I grow up. However, I must grow up to take the responsibility to face the society.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/guandaquant/guandaquant.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
